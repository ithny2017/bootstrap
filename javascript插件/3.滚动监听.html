            <p>PHP, an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language.

                It is an HTML embedded scripting language and is especially suited for web development. The basic syntax of PHP is similar to

                C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. PHP is used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages quickly, but you can do

                much more with PHP.

                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language developed by Netscape. JavaScript was created

                by Netscape programmer Brendan Eich. It was first released under the name of LiveScript as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in

                September 1995. It was renamed JavaScript on December 4, 1995. As JavaScript works on the client side, It is mostly used for

                client-side web development.

                The term NoSQL was coined by Carlo Strozzi in the year 1998. He used this term to name his Open Source, Light

                Weight, DataBase which did not have an SQL interface.In the early 2009, when last.fm wanted to organize an event on open-

                source distributed databases, Eric Evans, a Rackspace employee, reused the term to refer databases which are non-relational,

                distributed, and does not conform to atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability - four obvious features of traditional

                relational database systems.</p>
